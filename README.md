# Kaboom Tutorial Practice

This is a project I built by following a tutorial by JSLegendDev/ [YouTube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy_fSStEgMs&t=2s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org).
All credit to the original creator.  
My goal was to practice Kaboom.js basics, fix bugs, and understand the structure.

## Not my original work
This code is mostly based on the tutorial.  
I claim **no ownership** over the original logic/art â€” purely educational.
